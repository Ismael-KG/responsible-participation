# Community Practices and Pathways to Contribution

###### tags: `SIG`

**Information**
This document is a work-in-progress version of the community practices and pathways to contribution for the 'facilitating responsible participation in data science' interest group. 

It is heavily influenced by the [Turing Way's community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html).

## :busts_in_silhouette: Community Practices 

This special interest group is founded upon a belief and commitment to the value of responsible participation, both in terms of data science practices and also the organisation and practices of the special interest group itself.

In the context of this group, the term 'responsibility' is evoked to reflect an ongoing commitment to **reflective**, **deliberative**, **inclusive**, and **responsive** practices.[^RRI] The following principles outline how these concepts can be put into practice in all of the group's activities.

The organisers and members of the special interest group are committed to:

- **Reflecting on our own ideas and ways of working through open and respectful conversation** 
- **Building consensus and resolving tensions through ethical deliberation**
- **Recognising and promoting the inherent value of diverse viewpoints by remaining inclusive and open in all our activities**
- **Promoting transparency to invite collaboration and being responsive to new opportunities to improve**

The special interest group has a variety of pathways for contributing, and project members should feel empowered to propose new pathways as well. 

The simplest method of contribution is to simply come along to any project meeting and just observe. However, if you wish to have a more active role in the community, the following examples have varying levels of time commitment:
