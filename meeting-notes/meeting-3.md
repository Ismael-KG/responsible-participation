## :rewind: Recap of Previous Meetings

### :tada: Celebrating Success

Congratulations to Mhairi Aitken, Ana Basiri, and Jon Crowcroft for their fantastic evening of comedy and public engagement as part of the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas! 

Here's the video :point_down:

### :busstop: Code of Conduct and Pathways to Contribution

We need to develop a document that sets out how members can contibute to the SIG, which also include an informal set of principles for the community. The following document has been set up to help collaboratively draft this, taking inspiration from the Turing Way community handbook.

### :books: Curated Resources (Zotero)

The Zotero library for co-creating a curated set of resources on the topic of responsible participation is live. Please add to the library to help build a shared set of curated resources.

### Possible Topics

- Topic 1

### Interesting Methods

- 

### Notes

- Use of deliberative prompts that could promote discussion among participants who are either not able to attend or do not feel comfortable speaking live.
    - Example notes here: https://hackmd.io/@ols-2/example-breakout-notes/edit (live example notes online: https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/schedule/#week-02)
- otter.ai for live transcripts and silent notetaking for facilitating non-verbal discussions
    - We have a preprint describing this: https://osf.io/k3bfn/
- can we use this as an opportunity for participatory science in action, e.g. inviting people who are going to be impacted by the research to co-present 

## :file_folder: Possible Projects

### :black_nib: Collaborative Post on Responsible Research and Innovation

What does responsible participation mean?

Using the project lifecycle to understand interconnected roles and responsibilities. 

### :page_with_curl: Participatory Peer Review 

Using principles of open design and open science to make peer review accessible and resilient.
