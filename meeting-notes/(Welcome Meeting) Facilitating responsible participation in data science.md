:mag: About the SIG
---
- The primary aim of this special interest group is to understand better the needs and demands of different groups of users and stakeholders to ensure fair treatment from and access to the development and benefits of data-driven technologies. This is particularly important for safety critical services and technologies (e.g. healthcare) or in public sector organisations that are responsible for socially significant decision-making (e.g. geolocation services).
- The following image represents a simplified schematic of a typical data science or ML project lifecyle. It is helpful to think about how various biases (e.g. missing data bias) impact different stages, and how the effects may cascade through the subsequent parts of the lifecyle. It is also important to remember that this process—of research and innovation—does not occur in isolation; it is always *socially situated*.

:bulb: Possible Topics & Projects
---

### Questions

The following questions represent possible topics that can be used to anchor projects for the special interest group:

- What guidance do we need to have in place to ensure that stakeholder participation is meaningful, effective, and inclusive?
- How does biased participation, as reflected in data-driven technologies and services, affect and alter our understanding of society and the environment?
- Can we identify and understand the underlying barriers to participation from missing or biased data?
- What are the ethical implica tions of addressing these scientific and sociotechnical concerns?
- How can we measure the success of a crowdsourced or participatory project (e.g. metrics for inclusivity)?
- How do you maintain meaningful participation at scale?
    - Weighting of individuals to aim for representative paticipation.
- How do you combine offline and online methods of participation?

### Projects

- One project that would be a good starting point, and piossibly useful for a reading group, would be the development of a curated bibliography. Members could add links to useful resources, along with a short description of why the resource is interesting, useful, or worth reading.

### Are there any barriers to participating in this group that we need to consider?
- I'm aware of a few people trying to implement "No Meeting Fridays"
- Previous text:
    - Malvika: I am happy to discuss if a contributing pathways like this might be useful ([link](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)). This is not to restrict the structure, but make it easier for people to identify how and where they can participate. Often barriers could be not knowing what the expectations are.
    - Chris: agreed. I think we should have something like this moving forward, and I am happy to draft something. We will be committed to allowing members to participate as much or as little as they can manage. We do not want there to be barriers that prevent individuals from simply joining a meeting and listening to the discussion. If that's all they can manage that's fine. 

### What is the best way to collaborate going forward?

All of these are possible options for group communication and collaboration:

- Slack
- Sharepoint
- Loomio
- Gitter
- Zotero

### Frequency
- Monthly for plenaries
    - However, there is an option for reading groups and other simultaneous meetings that do not require participation from all members. 

:notebook: Notes
---
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

- To what extent do the topics of this SIG extend to digital humanities? 
- Can checklists and guidelines be developed?
- Do we have any defined roles for people they can play in this group?
    - Ana and Chris will be chairing
    - Other members can participate and contribute as they go along
    - There maybe spin off projects
- Data literacy
    - Chris is in the process of organising, as part of the Turing's online training, a series of seminars and online materials that will focus on responsible research and innovation. Part of this will cover topics in data literacy. 
- Maintaining diversity of opinions
    - Processes that we can try to increase participation of people who share different concerns? 
    - Often contributors of citizen/participatory science are people who are able to participate.
    - What are the evidence to show success?
    - How can we use different methods to increases participation and successfully facilitate it? Deliberative engagement that allows different views to be expressed (online deliberative methods combined with face to face methods)
- Creating a common understanding of 'participation' and 'responsible' for everyone (the SIG title)
    - Responsible comes from 'responsible research and innovation' ([summary text](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethics-intro.html#responsible-research-and-innovation)).
      > “\[RRI is\] an approach that anticipates and assesses potential implications and societal expectations with regard to research and innovation, with the aim to foster the design of inclusive and sustainable research and innovation” - (European Commission, n.d.).
    - Responsible doesn't always include accountability
    - Owen et al. (2013) A Framework for Responsible Innovation - offers a principles-based approach, centred on the following four concepts:
        - Anticipatory
        - Reflective
        - Deliberative
        - Responsive
    - Participation: a choice of term to reflect a broader inclusion of people who are involved in data-driven decision-making and affected/impacted by those decisions.
    - On scope of participation (in context of geospatial data science): there is a growing digital divide between developed and developing countries.
