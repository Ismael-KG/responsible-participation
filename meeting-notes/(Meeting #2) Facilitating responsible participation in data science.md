## :rewind: Recap of Previous Meeting

### :envelope: Communication Channels

- Slack Channel update

### :busstop: Pathways to Contribution (and Recognition)

- In the previous meeting, the idea was raised of having a document that set out how members could contibute to the SIG. This could include an informal set of principles that the members would adhere to.
- We could also use this as a way of welcoming new members.
- Are all members happy to be listed on the SIG page?
- Suggestions:
    - [name=Sarah] RE Jupyter Book and meeting mins in HackMD. There is some integration between GitHub and HackMD (though it might be a clunky) and I've also maintained the Turing Way's Jupyter Book so I'm very happy to lend a helping hand in setting up these resources.

### :books: Curated Resources (Zotero)

- Chris has set up a Zotero library for the purpose of co-creating a curated set of resources on the topic of responsible participation:

## :file_folder: Possible Projects

- Collaborative blog post on creating a common understanding of 'responsible' and 'participation' in data science. 
    - Possible section in the Turing Way?
      - [name=Ismael] the [idea](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1315) has certainly been shared previously!
      - Some useful resources: https://collaborative-data.theodi.org/, https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit/#, https://actionproject.eu/toolkit/, https://citizensciencetoolkit.eu/
- Public Engagement Activities
    - [name=Mhairi] Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas - https://www.cabaretofdangerousideas.com/
    - A collaborative public engagement event between academics and comedians to engage the public in discussions around data science and AI.
    - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2avUKLdroR6wCYCLwsGmlulTkpT4omy
    - [name=Sarah] There is also [Bright Club](https://scienceshowoff.wordpress.com/bright-club/)
- Using missingness as guide to bias or participation
    - [name=Ana] Defining the success factors for a crowdsourcing project. Gathering some of the success factors of any crowdsourcing project (which can be extended too): - commenting on this [diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsensible/VGI/main/Diagrammes/VGI%20Success%20Factors.svg)
- Proposals from members
	- [name=Georgia] Health research, healthcare providers/carers, and patients/people who are affected by health research come together in a session to understand how research ultimatly impacts individuals
	- [name=Georgia] co-creation session for online moderation processes, code of conduct 
	- [name=Georgia] templates for participation for things like repos, issues, meetings - a lot are available in The Turing Way; possibly adapting these for different groups (e.g. neurodiverse groups) 
	- [name=Georgia] who's not in the room iterations (taking ourselves as starting point) - who is not able to be involved and why; then we try to reach those people, and ask them the same question, so we understand increasingly who is being excluded (based on work by Tania Allard)
	- [name=Georgia] I would be interested in research into biases which are shared by experts, lay people, and those with lived experience, compared to those which are different across those groups
	- [name=Aida] Would it be too simplistic to draft together a sort of a 'checklist' for responsible participation?
	- [name=Jon] trigger warnings for research that is itself ok, but might inspire unethical misuse/appropriation (have examples) - could be public engagement - idea would be responsible AI equivalent to pugwash and asilomar (see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA and https://pugwash.org/history/) My slides on examples https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jac22/talks/ethical-triggers-2021.pptx

## :sparkles: Interesting Events

- Aida Mehonic posted in Slack about the following launch event: https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/event/legal-mechanisms-data-stewardship/

## :notebook: Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->

- How can crowdsourcing workflows be made more inclusive and representative (e.g., bias mitigation strategies)?
