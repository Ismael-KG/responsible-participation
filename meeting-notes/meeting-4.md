## :rewind: Recap of Previous Meetings

### :loudspeaker: SIG Seminars

We discussed the possibility of running a seminar series. This got delayed due to other priorities, but we would still like to push ahead with it (see related agenda point). 

## :file_folder: Possible Projects

<!--This section is for members to suggest projects that the group could engage with. Please add to the list.-->

### 1) Collaborative Writing Project

A [new document](https://hackmd.io/@cburr/ByeTpADWlK) has been created, which will allow project members to collaborate on a short article.

## Interested Parties

- Mhairi Aitken
- Ana Basiri: Sections on Types of missing data and Biases 
- Malvika: Why is participation important (governance) and RRI general resource
- Martin: NHS data sharing
- Georgia

A public [Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2746789/facilitating_responsible_participation_in_data_science/collections/52BSWIR3) has also been set up to help manage references, and maybe serve as a curated resource.

### 2) Curated Resources (Zotero)

The Zotero library for co-creating a curated set of resources on the topic of responsible participation is live. Please add to the library to help build a shared set of curated resources.

- malvikasharan@gmail.com

### 3) Community Practices Document

I'm looking for some volunteers to help me with drafting and reviewing [this document](https://hackmd.io/@cburr/HkCW-1Smd/edit), which will be added to the webpage and sign-up form for the group.

### 4) Seminar Series

A public and accesible series of talks or workshops to meaningfully facilitate engagement in data science and AI. 

Possible opportunity for participatory science in action (e.g., inviting people who are going to be impacted by the research to co-present).

This list has now been moved to a [separate document](https://hackmd.io/@cburr/Hyr9_vqgY). 

NB: speak to Malvika about an email template for reaching out to potential invitees
