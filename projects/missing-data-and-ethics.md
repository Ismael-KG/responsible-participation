**About**
This is a work-in-progress article, being produced as part of the 'facilitating responsible participation in data science' interest group. The intention is to publish it on the Turing's website, and also look to host it with a website such as [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/uk).

## Planning

The following represent some initial starting points to be explored in a short article:

- Possible harms of missing data (educational/introductory piece)
    - Types of missing data
    - Biases they give rise to
- NHS sharing data (critical/commentary piece)
    - Social license
- Why is participation important (educational/activist piece)
    - Democratic governance
    - Sources of legitimacy
- Responsible research and innovation (overview/general resource)
    - What is responsible research and innovation 
    - How does it apply to facilitating engagement in data science and addressing the problem of missing data

## Dark data

Consider the types of dark data discussed in David Hand's book, Dark Data, in order to tease out the ethically salient issues associated with each data type

### Notes on Meeting (02/09/21)

- Educational piece (Turing)
- GPDPR (Conversation) - Lessons from care.data and need for public engagement, events that happened during Covid without public engagement.
- Representation and label bias – how do people define themselves; how are people classified/categorised by data?
    - Is this an example/case for a more general paper or a paper in its own right?
    -
