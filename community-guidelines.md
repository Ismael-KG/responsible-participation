# Community Practices and Pathways to Contribution

###### tags: `SIG`

:::info
**Information**
This document is a work-in-progress version of the community practices and pathways to contribution for the 'facilitating responsible participation in data science' interest group. 

It is heavily influenced by the [Turing Way's community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html). 
:::

## :busts_in_silhouette: Community Practices 

This special interest group is founded upon a belief and commitment to the value of responsible participation, both in terms of data science practices and also the organisation and practices of the special interest group itself.

In the context of this group, the term 'responsibility' is evoked to reflect an ongoing commitment to **reflective**, **deliberative**, **inclusive**, and **responsive** practices.[^RRI] The following principles outline how these concepts can be put into practice in all of the group's activities.

The organisers and members of the special interest group are committed to:

- **Reflecting on our own ideas and ways of working through open and respectful conversation** 
- **Building consensus and resolving tensions through ethical deliberation**
- **Recognising and promoting the inherent value of diverse viewpoints by remaining inclusive and open in all our activities**
- **Promoting transparency to invite collaboration and being responsive to new opportunities to improve**

## :computer: Ways of Working

### Notes to expand 

- Use of deliberative prompts that could promote discussion among participants who are either not able to attend or do not feel comfortable speaking live.
    - Example notes here: https://hackmd.io/@ols-2/example-breakout-notes/edit (live example notes online: https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/schedule/#week-02)
- otter.ai for live transcripts and silent notetaking for facilitating non-verbal discussions
    - We have a preprint describing this: https://osf.io/k3bfn/

The special interest group has a variety of pathways for contributing, and project members should feel empowered to propose new pathways as well. 

The simplest method of contribution is to simply come along to any project meeting and just observe. However, if you wish to have a more active role in the community, the following examples have varying levels of time commitment:

### :books: Curated Bibliography

The group has a shared Zotero library, which has been set-up with the goal of collectively creating a *curated list* of resources for those interested in responsible participation. 

You can [view the group library here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2746789/facilitating_responsible_participation_in_data_science/library).

To join the group library and contribute, you will need to request access. Please do this by sending an email with your Zotero username and email to cburr@turing.ac.uk

Please note the following guidlines before adding a resource:

1. Bibliographic information must be **usable and accurate**. Please do not just add a link without supporting information, such as author, publication year (etc.), and please check to make sure that the information is correct. While there is no minimum amount of information, please exercise good judgement. Zotero will do a good job of addign most information if you provide a DOI or ISBN when adding a resource. And, if something is missing, sites like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or [Google Books](https://books.google.com) can often help fill in the gaps. However, again, please check to make sure the information is correct.
2. Please add an accompanying note that explains why the resource is worth reading, and why it has been added. This is what will help make the list a **curated** set of resources, rather than a disorganised mess of readings.
3. If you are unfamiliar with Zotero—an open-source reference manager—a comprehensive set of documentation can be [found here](https://www.zotero.org/support/).

### :speaking_head_in_silhouette: Seminar/Workshop Series

The group organises and runs a series of public seminars and workshops. You can see the current list and make a recommendation for someone to invite on the [following document](https://hackmd.io/@cburr/Hyr9_vqgY). 

### :black_nib: Collaborative Writing

If you have an idea for a blog post, paper, or some other form of collaborative writing, please do feel free to reach out to the group members. We will maintain a list of open and closed projects here, which will contain details for the point of contact in case your wish to contribute.
